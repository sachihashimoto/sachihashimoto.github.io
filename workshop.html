<p> <h3>Abstracts</h3></p>


<p><b>Sachi Hashimoto: Introductory Lecture </b><br><br>
In this introductory lecture, we will study curves over valuated fields and their combinatorial structure. Tropical geometry and number theory study the degeneration of curves in this setting. We give definitions from both fields, discuss semistable models, and give motivation for the following week's lectures.  
</p>
 </p>
 <p><b>Paul Helminck: Computing reduction types of varieties using tropical geometry</b><br><br>
In this talk, I will give a general technique to find poset substructures of schemes using discrete Galois-data associated to coverings. In particular, this gives a fast algorithm to calculate dual intersection complexes of semistable models of varieties, provided a suitable covering is given. I will show how tropical geometry and schön compactifications of branch loci can be used to generate these coverings.
  </p>
<p><b>Ole Ossen: Semistable reduction of plane quartics </b><br><br>
    I will explain how to describe models of curves using valuations. This will be applied to studying models of the projective line and models of coverings of curves. Specifically, we will discuss the problem of determining the semistable reduction of plane quartics via suitable maps to the projective line, including the wild case of reduction at p=3.
</p>

<p> <b> 
Emeryck Marie: Mirror symmetry and tropical geometry
</b>
<br><br>
This short talk is meant to advertise a seminar to be hold  
this spring/summer about tropical aspects of mirror symmetry. We will  
mainly be interested in the case of projective spaces (or even only  
P^2), and follow the book of Mark Gross "Tropical geometry and mirror  
symmetry". This talk will briefly review classical mirror symmetry of  
P^2 (expressed as an isomorphism of certain systems of differential  
equations), and then comment on the program for the seminar.
</p>
<p><b>Bernd Sturmfels: Tropical Plane Curves</b> <br> <br>
Tropical geometry is a combinatorial shadow of classical geometry. Algebraic curves in the tropical plane are dual to triangulations of convex polygons. We discuss the intrinsic geometry of these objects, with focus on the moduli space of metric graphs that represent tropical plane curves. This lectures is based on work with Sarah Brodsky, Michael Joswig and Ralph Morrision from nearly a decade ago (arXiv:1409.4395).
  <p><b>Adam Morgan: Cluster pictures and semistable models of hyperelliptic curves</b> <br><br>
Let C:y^2=f(x) be a hyperelliptic curve over a local field of odd residue characteristic. I will discuss joint work with Tim and Vladimir Dokchitser, and Celine Maistret, demonstrating how several arithmetic invariants of the curve and its Jacobian, most notably its potential stable reduction, can be described in terms of simple combinatorial data involving the p-adic distances between the roots of f(x). </p>
 <p> <b>Stefano Mereta: Tropical geometry and Berkovich analytification</b><br><br>
 I will introduce the concept of Berkovich analytification and discuss briefly the motivations that led to its definition. We will go through the interesting example of the affine line, state the inverse limit theorem proved by Sam Payne, linking the tropical and the Berkovich world, and sketch its proof.
